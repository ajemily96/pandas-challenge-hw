## Heros of Pymoli

At first glance it seems that Heros of Pymoli's target audience is males in the age range of 15-25. While, yes, the data does suggest that the largest percentage of participants lie in the age range of 15-25 and are male, looking deeper into the data will reveal that there is promising gains if the game were to attract a larger female or older audience.

The analysis done on participation by age group shows that over 63% of participants are between the ages of 15 and 25 and correspondingly the total amount of money generated by this age group, particularly 20-24, is by far the greatest.

However, if we look closer at the average purchase per person we can see that individuals in the 35-39 year age range spend the most on average. *(The next highest spending group on average is the < 10 years group. Which begs the question, where are these children getting all of this money to spend on games?)*

Similarly, the analysis on participation by gender shows that although males make up the vast majority of the participants (a whopping 84%), females spend $0.40 more on average than males and other/non-disclosed spend on average $0.49 more than males.

Though males and persons age 15-25 make up the largest portion of the participants, they are on average more frugle than some of their minority counterparts. Additional analysis would need to be done to determine if initiatives to entice players from these other demographics would serve as profitable or if there were extreme outliers which skewed the data.
